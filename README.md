# Obscure
Say goodbye to boring camera backgrounds with Obscure!

## Installation
Thes fastest way to get the plugin up and running is through the releases:

## Development
Clone the repo with the required submodules:
```
git clone --recursive git@github.com:lef-fan/obscure.git
```
or if you have already cloned the project without the submodules needed, then:
```
git submodule update --init --recursive
```
Update the submodules (necessary for libtorch library):
```
sh update_submodules.sh
```
Install required libs for python:
```
pip install -r python/requirements.txt
```
Convert the model:
```
python python/model_conversion.py
```
Build the plugin:
```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
make
```
